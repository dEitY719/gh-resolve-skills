"""Hermes Agent registration for the `gh-resolve` skills plugin.

Registers the three PR blocked-state recovery skills with Hermes' native skill
loader so `skill_view("gh-resolve:<name>")` can load them on demand.

This plugin injects no session bootstrap context. All three skills are
explicitly invoked — you reach for one when GitHub has greyed out a merge
button — so there is nothing worth paying for on every first turn. Two of them
rewrite published history with `--force-with-lease`, which is another reason a
bootstrap preamble nudging the model toward them would be wrong.
