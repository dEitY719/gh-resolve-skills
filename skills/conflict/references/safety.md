# gh-resolve:conflict — Safety Nets

## Backup SHA

Always captured before `git rebase`:

```bash
BACKUP_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

Printed up front so the user can paste it into a recovery command:

```
backup SHA: <sha>
  undo everything :  git reset --hard <sha>
  inspect history :  git reflog
```

`git reflog` is always a fallback — every rebase step is tracked there
for ~90 days by default, so even `reset --hard` mistakes are usually
recoverable.

## Auto-stash

Triggered only when preflight detects a non-empty working tree
(`git status --porcelain` prints any line). In `--worktree` mode that trigger
can never fire *for a freshly created scratch worktree this round* — the
caller (`gh-pr:merge-train`) just ran `git worktree add`, and nothing has
written to it yet — so the whole stash flow is skipped, and the final
report's `Stash:` line is omitted. This is distinct from a worktree the
caller is *reusing* after an interrupted prior round (a crashed process, or
one this skill itself left conflicted at a stop point below) — that tree can
absolutely be dirty or mid-rebase, which is exactly what the in-progress
operation guard right below exists to catch. "Clean by construction" is a
claim about the fresh-add case only, never about an arbitrary `<path>`.

1. Announce before running:

    ```
    Working tree is dirty. Auto-stashing:
      git stash push -u -m "gh-resolve:conflict auto-stash <timestamp>"
    ```

2. Stash:

    ```bash
    STASH_MSG="gh-resolve:conflict auto-stash $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
    git stash push -u -m "$STASH_MSG"
    STASH_REF=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash)
    ```

3. Proceed with fetch + rebase.

4. After a successful push (or on clean abort), pop:

    ```bash
    git stash pop "$STASH_REF" 2>/dev/null || \
      echo "stash preserved — resolve and then: git stash pop $STASH_REF"
    ```

5. If `pop` itself conflicts, stop and print the stash ref. Never drop
   the stash automatically.

## In-progress operation guard

Always resolve marker paths through `git rev-parse --git-path`. In a git
worktree the actual paths are under `.git/worktrees/<wt>/`, and hardcoded
`.git/<name>` checks silently miss the marker.

In `--worktree` mode this guard still runs — a scratch worktree abandoned
mid-rebase by an interrupted run is exactly what it catches — with every `git`
below taking `-C "<path>"`.

```bash
for name in rebase-merge rebase-apply MERGE_HEAD CHERRY_PICK_HEAD REVERT_HEAD; do
    marker=$(git rev-parse --git-path "$name")
    if [ -e "$marker" ]; then
        echo "in-progress operation detected: $marker"
        echo "finish or abort it first:"
        echo "  git rebase --continue / --abort"
        echo "  git merge --continue / --abort"
        echo "  git cherry-pick --continue / --abort"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

## `--force-with-lease` vs `--force`

`--force-with-lease` refuses the push if the remote ref has moved since
you last fetched. That protects against:

- a reviewer pushing a fix directly to your branch while you rebased,
- an automation bot (dependabot, renovate) rebasing on top of you,
- another machine of yours pushing from the same branch.

Plain `--force` blows past all of that. This skill refuses to use it.

If `--force-with-lease` rejects the push, the upstream moved. Show:

```
Push rejected by --force-with-lease: upstream has new commits you haven't seen.
  git fetch <remote>
  git log --oneline HEAD..<remote>/<branch>
Decide whether to merge those in or discard them, then re-run this skill.
```

## Never run on the default branch

All three skills carry this refusal, each with its own exit code; `#10` is the
anchor that ties the copies together, the way `dEitY719/dotfiles#1403` ties the three
`github-target.md` copies. Change one, grep the number and change the others.

```bash
CURRENT=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
if ! DEFAULT=$(GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST" gh repo view "$TARGET_REPO" \
        --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name) || [ -z "$DEFAULT" ]; then
    echo "refuse: could not resolve the default branch of $TARGET_REPO."
    echo "the guard fails closed — fix the gh call or the Step 1 target binding."
    exit 1
fi
if [ "$CURRENT" = "$DEFAULT" ]; then
    echo "refuse: currently on the default branch ($DEFAULT)."
    echo "check out the PR's head branch first."
    exit 1
fi
```

`$TARGET_REPO` is **positional**: `gh repo view` has no `--repo` flag (#10).
The old `--repo "$TARGET_REPO"`, copied from the neighbouring `gh pr view`
calls, exited 1 every time; `DEFAULT` was empty, `[ "main" = "" ]` was false,
and the run continued to Step 4's `git push --force-with-lease` on the default
branch.

Test the **exit status**, not just the string. `[ -z "$DEFAULT" ]` alone is
enough only because `gh repo view` writes its error to stderr; a command that
prints on failure would sail through. `gh api "repos/$TARGET_REPO" --jq
.default_branch` — the tempting alternative, since `github-target.md` already
puts a repo in a `gh api` path — is exactly that command: on a 404 it skips
`--jq` and echoes `{"message":"Not Found",...}` to stdout, which is non-empty
and equals no branch name. Keep the check in the `if`, not as a trailing
`|| DEFAULT=""`: both are correct, but two PR #11 reviewers read the trailing
form as discarding the status, and a guard that reads as unsafe gets
"corrected" back into a hole.

The default branch should never be force-pushed by this skill. If the
PR's head IS the default branch (cross-fork PR where the head came from
a fork), that's out of scope — tell the user and stop.

In `--worktree` mode `git -C "<path>" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` answers
`HEAD` — the worktree is detached and has no branch to compare. The guard is
not dropped, it moves to the thing that is actually at risk: substitute
`HEAD_REF` (the PR's `headRefName`, which the push refspec targets) for
`CURRENT` and refuse on a match. Only the compared value changes — the
`DEFAULT` lookup and its unresolved-refusal `if` run unchanged, so a failed
lookup stops the worktree path too.

## Recovery cheat-sheet (for the final report)

```
If something went wrong:
  git rebase --abort                 # during rebase
  git reset --hard <BACKUP_SHA>      # after rebase, before push
  git reflog                          # rummage for any lost ref
  git stash list                      # auto-stash survives even if pop fails
```
