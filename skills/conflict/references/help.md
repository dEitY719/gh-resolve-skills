# gh-resolve:conflict — Help

## Arguments

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `[pr-number]` | Positional 1 — target PR to resolve, e.g. `168`. | PR attached to the current branch |
| `[remote]` | Positional 2 — git remote whose repo owns the PR. | `origin` |
| `--worktree <path>` | Run every git command in `<path>` instead of the current checkout. Requires an explicit `pr-number`. | current checkout |
| `-h` / `--help` / `help` | Print this help verbatim and stop. No API calls. | — |

## Usage

```
/gh-resolve:conflict              # PR attached to current branch, origin
/gh-resolve:conflict 168          # explicit PR, origin
/gh-resolve:conflict 168 upstream # explicit PR, upstream remote
/gh-resolve:conflict 168 origin --worktree /path/to/scratch   # rebase there
/gh-resolve:conflict -h           # this help
```

`--worktree` exists for `gh-pr:merge-train`: the PR's head branch is usually
already checked out in the worktree `gh-flow:issue` opened it from, so the train
hands over a detached scratch worktree it created and will destroy. The push
then uses an explicit `HEAD:refs/heads/<head>` refspec, since a detached HEAD
names no branch, and the auto-stash never fires — the scratch tree is clean.

## When to use this skill

- GitHub shows **"This branch has conflicts that must be resolved"** on a PR.
- A colleague's PR merged first and your PR's base (usually `main`) has moved.
- You want to stay on the `--rebase` policy track — no merge commits.

## When NOT to use

- Conflicts are trivial enough that `gh pr merge --rebase` handles them.
  (Use `/gh-pr:merge` — if it fails with `CONFLICTING`, come back here.)
- You prefer a merge-commit strategy. This skill refuses that; edit the
  PR with `git merge main` manually if that's really what you want.
- You are on the repo's default branch. The skill refuses — create or
  check out the feature branch first.

## What the skill does

1. Parses args. Auto-detects the PR from the current branch if omitted.
2. Prints a **backup SHA** so `git reset --hard <sha>` can undo everything.
3. Stashes a dirty working tree (announced before stashing).
4. Fetches the base branch and runs `git rebase origin/<base>`.
5. On each conflicting commit:
   - lists conflicted paths,
   - shows the rebase context (commit-applying + remaining commits),
   - walks the user through each file,
   - runs `git add` and `git rebase --continue` after confirmation.
6. Pushes with `git push --force-with-lease` (never plain `--force`).
7. Calls `gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` to confirm the
   GitHub warning is cleared.
8. Pops any stash it created.

## Safety

- **Backup SHA** printed before the rebase — `git reset --hard <sha>`
  restores the pre-rebase state; `git reflog` is always available too.
- **Stash** — only auto-applied if preflight detects a dirty tree, and
  always announced. Popped at the end even on failure paths. Never fires
  under `--worktree`, where the tree is clean by construction.
- **Worktree lifecycle is the caller's** — with `--worktree <path>` the skill
  operates inside that path but never creates or removes it.
- **`--force-with-lease`** — rejects the push if someone else pushed to
  the branch while you rebased. The skill stops; it does NOT silently
  re-fetch and re-rebase.
- **Abort** — if you want out mid-rebase, type `git rebase --abort` in
  a separate shell; the skill will detect the abort on the next
  iteration and stop cleanly.

## What this skill will NOT do

- Create a merge commit. Rebase-only. Non-negotiable.
- Run `git push --force` (without `-with-lease`).
- Run on the repo's default branch.
- Guess how to resolve an ambiguous conflict. If the commit message
  doesn't make the choice obvious, it asks.
- Re-pull-and-rebase after a rejected `--force-with-lease`. It reports
  the divergence and stops, so you can decide.

  by reading failing check logs and pushing a fix. Different verb
  (read-logs-and-edit vs rebase) for the same PR-lifecycle slot.
- `gh-pr:merge` — merge an already-clean PR (rebase/squash/merge).
- `gh-pr:merge-emergency` — admin-bypass merge with audit trail.
- `gh-pr:create` — create a PR from the current branch.
- `gh-pr:reply` — reply to PR review comments after rebasing.
